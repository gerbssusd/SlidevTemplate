# Ad Hominem / Straw Man

<!-- Slide 2 -->

layout: center
---

# Context — Ad Hominem / Straw Man

Trump calls Democratic veterans "traitors" and accuses them of "seditious behavior … punishable by death."

<!-- Slide 3 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Explanation — Ad Hominem / Straw Man

Rather than addressing the substance of their argument (that service members can refuse illegal orders), the rhetoric attacks their character and frames them as existential threats. This is a personal attack (ad hominem) and misrepresents their intentions (a straw man).

# Appeal to Fear

<!-- Slide 5 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Context — Appeal to Fear

Statements framing lawmakers' guidance to refuse illegal orders as “dangerous to our Country” and “seditious behavior.”

<!-- Slide 6 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Explanation — Appeal to Fear

Uses fear of national collapse to bypass substantive argument.

# Slippery Slope

<!-- Slide 8 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Context — Slippery Slope

Suggesting that because these lawmakers say “refuse illegal orders,” it somehow justifies “punishment by death” or execution.

<!-- Slide 9 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Explanation — Slippery Slope

Jumps from a legal or moral argument (refusing illegal orders) to an extreme consequence (execution) without logical justification for that escalation.

# False Dichotomy

<!-- Slide 11 -->

layout: center
---

# Context — False Dichotomy

Trump’s framing seems to suggest that you’re either with him (law and order) or you support “traitors” who want military mutiny.

<!-- Slide 12 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Explanation — False Dichotomy

It oversimplifies the issue into two opposing camps, ignoring nuanced positions (e.g., legal frameworks, constitutional protections, duty).

# Misused Appeal to Authority

<!-- Slide 14 -->

layout: center
---

# Context — Misused Appeal to Authority

The CDC changed its website to say “the claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim.”

<!-- Slide 15 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Explanation — Misused Appeal to Authority

The change may be framed as authoritative (coming from a trusted public health institution), but if it's not grounded in scientific evidence, it's a problematic appeal. Experts quoted claim the CDC is being “weaponized.”

# Conspiracy / Guilt by Association

<!-- Slide 17 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Context — Conspiracy / Guilt by Association

Claims that the CDC is being “weaponized” to promote RFK Jr.’s anti-vaccine views.

<!-- Slide 18 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Explanation — Conspiracy / Guilt by Association

Suggesting a hidden agenda or conspiracy behind credible public health messaging, without necessarily providing concrete proof of a coordinated campaign.

# Cherry Picking

<!-- Slide 20 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Context — Cherry Picking

In coverage of the BBC bias allegations, there are specific instances of edited speeches to suggest systemic bias. 

<!-- Slide 21 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Explanation — Cherry Picking

Highlighting a few edited clips can be used to generalize about overall editorial direction, even though they may not represent the full context or the broadcaster’s broader content.

# Hasty Generalization

<!-- Slide 23 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Context — Hasty Generalization

More than 30 countries oppose a U.N. draft text because it doesn't phase out fossil fuels.

<!-- Slide 24 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Explanation — Hasty Generalization

Assuming that because a significant number of countries oppose the text, it's “bad” or unbalanced, without examining each country’s reasoning or the nuance of the negotiations.

<!-- Slide 25 -->

# Appeal to Consequences

<!-- Slide 26 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Context — Appeal to Consequences

Critics say Trump’s plan to open 1.3 billion acres of U.S. waters to drilling “would risk the health … of millions of people” and “devastate ocean ecosystems.”

<!-- Slide 27 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Explanation — Appeal to Consequences

Arguing that a policy is wrong because of potential negative outcomes, which may be speculative or not fully substantiated, rather than evaluating the policy on its own merits or tradeoffs.

# Post Hoc / Misleading Cause

<!-- Slide 29 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Context — Post Hoc / Misleading Cause

Connecting CDC messaging changes to RFK Jr.'s activism.

<!-- Slide 30 -->

---
layout: center
---

# Explanation — Post Hoc / Misleading Cause

Assuming causation (that RFK Jr.’s views caused the CDC change) without definitive proof of a causal mechanism; correlation is being used to imply causation.

# Conclusion

Logical fallacies appear frequently in news and political rhetoric. Understanding them sharpens critical thinking.
